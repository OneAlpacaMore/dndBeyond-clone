# Welcome to the DndBeyond-Clone Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the DndBeyond-Clone Project! As an avid fan of roleplaying board games and a spiring web developer, I've undertaken the challenge of recreating the design of the DnD Beyond webpage using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as a personal challenge and will be a valuable addition to my portfolio. I am eager to learn and grow throughout this process and I welcome any constructive criticism at any stage of the project.

Once the design phase is complete, I will focus on implementing the functionalities. You can find the project documentation in the [DOCUMENTATION.md](/docs/DOCUMENTATION.md) file.

## Disclaimer
I would like to clarify that I do not own any of the images used in this project. They remain the property of their respective authors. In the [RESOURCES.md](./docs/RESOURCES.md) file, you will find a comprehensive list of all the artists and authors whose work has been used. If you happen to be the author of any of the images or content and wish for it to be removed from this project, please feel free to contact me via direct message (DM).
